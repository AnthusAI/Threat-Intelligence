Feature: Newspaper layout scenarios
  Layout scenarios are durable examples of newspaper behavior.
  They verify both the solver's decisions and the rendered page geometry.

  Scenario: Current edition renders from the composable layout engine
    Given I open the "current-edition" layout scenario at 1280 by 900
    Then the active content scenario should be "current-edition"
    And the active content source should be "scenario"
    And the active edition should expose a composable layout plan
    And the solved layout should use 6 columns
    And the front page should label article "agent-procedure-patterns" as continued on page 2
    And the front page should label article "schools-reading-lab" as continued on page 3
    And the front page should label article "market-hall" as continued on page 3
    When I scroll to page 3
    Then the active page should be a "regionStack" page
    And no measured line should be cropped
    And no solved furniture should overlap within a section
